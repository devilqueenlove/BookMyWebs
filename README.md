## TODO LIST — Reality Check, Priorities & Next-Level Features

### 1. **Firebase Backend & Data Model**

- You _need_ backend persistence before anything else. Firebase is perfect for quick setup.
- Plan your data schema carefully: bookmarks grouped by user ID, secure with strict Firebase rules.
- Without this, all your work stays local and useless for real users.

**Start here. No backend = no future.**

---

### 2. **User Authentication**

- Use Firebase Auth (Google/GitHub/Apple OAuth).
- Don’t roll your own auth unless you want a nightmare.
- Link user sessions tightly with bookmarks data for privacy and ownership.

---

### 3. **Cloud Sync Across Devices**

- Real-time or near-real-time sync is non-negotiable for multi-device use.
- Handle syncing conflicts gracefully (last write wins or timestamps).
- Firebase’s realtime DB or Firestore can handle this out-of-the-box.

---

### 4. **Drag & Drop Sorting and Reordering**

- Essential UX when bookmark count grows.
- Use battle-tested libs like `react-beautiful-dnd` or `dnd-kit`.
- Sync reordered states to backend or user will lose changes.
- **Don’t do this before backend + sync is rock solid.**

---

### 5. **Browser Extension MVP**

- Massive UX boost: save bookmarks instantly from any webpage.
- Keep MVP minimal: send URL + title to your app using `postMessage`.
- Later add context menu integration for right-click saves.
- Extension and web app are separate but tightly linked projects.

---

### 6. **Import/Export Bookmarks**

- Real users want to migrate.
- Support Chrome, Firefox, Safari exported bookmarks (HTML/JSON).
- Export to JSON, HTML, CSV for backup.
- Implement after your core sync and UX features.

## Beyond the Basics — Features to Make Your App Professional & Future-Proof

### Core Enhancements

- **Offline Support & Sync Queue**
  Work offline, sync when online. Use IndexedDB or Firebase offline persistence.

- **Tagging & Multi-Category Support**
  Users want flexible organization, not single categories only.

- **Favicon Caching & Lazy Loading**
  Don’t hammer Google’s favicon API; cache favicons locally.
  Lazy-load bookmarks for performance.

- **Bookmark Previews (Screenshots)**
  Show page thumbnails for better browsing.

- **Advanced Search**
  Full-text, filter by tags, categories, description.

---

### UX/UI

- **Dark Mode / Themes** — mandatory in 2025. Tailwind makes this trivial.
- **Mobile-First + PWA** — mobile users expect smooth responsive and installable apps.
- **Bulk Operations** — multi-select for delete/move/tag.
- **Drag & Drop Categories** — reorder categories, not just bookmarks.

---

### Security & Privacy

- **Client-side Encryption** — encrypt bookmarks before cloud storage.
- **OAuth Social Logins** — reduce friction, increase security.
- **Session Management & Token Refresh** — seamless multi-device login.

---

### Integrations

- **Browser Context Menu Integration** — right-click save from extension.
- **Import from & Export to Popular Formats** — Chrome, Firefox, Safari bookmarks.
- **Third-party API Integration** — Pocket, Raindrop.io import/export.

---

### Developer & Maintainability

- **Testing (Unit + Integration)** — Jest, React Testing Library for reliability.
- **State Management** — move beyond React local state if complexity grows (Redux/Zustand).
- **Code Splitting & Lazy Loading** — optimize performance for large datasets.

---

### Analytics & User Feedback

- **Usage Analytics (Opt-in)** — learn what users actually use.
- **In-app Bug Reporting & Feature Requests** — gather user feedback directly.

---

### Advanced / Bonus Ideas

- **AI-Powered Suggestions** — auto-suggest tags, related bookmarks.
- **Bookmark Expiry & Auto-Archiving** — manage stale bookmarks automatically.
- **Collaborative Bookmark Sharing** — share collections or collaborate in teams.

---

## Summary: What to Focus On & When

1. **Firebase backend + authentication + cloud sync** (foundation).
2. **Drag and drop bookmark sorting with synced order.**
3. **Minimal browser extension MVP for quick adds.**
4. **Import/export for real user migration needs.**
5. **Then polish UX with offline support, tags, previews, dark mode.**
6. **Add security, testing, and analytics to mature the product.**
